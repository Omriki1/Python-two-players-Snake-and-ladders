# Python-two-players-Snake-and-ladders
Python two players Snake and ladders i made for my school begginer course on paython and networking 
The purpose of the project is to have fun and play with friends. I had a blast time making it and experimenting with python and its various liabreris which I hadn't known before. So I hope you would like it :)

I learnt and used a few tools to make this project. tkinter, pygame, threading and more!!!.
